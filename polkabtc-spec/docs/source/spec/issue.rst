Issue
=====

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The issue module allows as user to create new PolkaBTC tokens. The user needs to request PolkaBTC through the :ref:`requestIssue` function, then send BTC to a Vault, and finally complete the issuing of PolkaBTC by calling the :ref:`executeIssue` function. Below is a high-level step-by-step description of the protocol and a figure explaining the steps.

Step-by-step
------------

1. Precondition: a Vault has locked collateral as described in the `Vault registry <vault-registry>`_.
2. A user executes the ``requestIssue`` function to open an issue request on the BTC Parachain. The issue request includes the amount of PolkaBTC the user wants to have, which Vault the user uses, and a small collateral to prevent `griefing <griefing>`_.
3. A user sends the equivalent amount of BTC that he wants to issue as PolkaBTC to the Vault on the Bitcoin blockchain with the ``lockBTC`` function. The user extracts a transaction inclusion proof of that locking transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain.
4. The user executes the ``executeIssue`` function on the BTC Parachain. The issue function requires a reference to the previous issue request and the transaction inclusion proof of the ``lockBTC`` transaction. If the function completes successfully, the user receives the requested amount of PolkaBTC into his account.
5. Optional: If the user is not able to complete the issue request within the predetermined time frame (``CommitPeriod``), anyone is able to call the ``abort`` function to cancel the issue request.

Data Model
~~~~~~~~~~

.. .. todo:: We need to handle replay attacks. Idea: include a short unique hash, e.g. the ``issueId`` and the ``RedeemId`` in the BTC transaction in the ``OP_RETURN`` field. That way, we can check if it is the correct transaction.

.. .. todo:: The hash creation for ``issueId`` and ``RedeemId`` must be unique. Proposal: use a combination of Substrate's ``random_seed()`` method together with a ``nonce`` and the ``AccountId`` of a CbA-user and CbA-Redeemer. 

.. .. warning:: Substrate's built in module to generate random data needs 80 blocks to actually generate random data.


Scalars
-------

.. todo:: Move this to the new collateral module?


MinimumCollateralUser
.....................

The minimum collateral (DOT) a user needs to provide as griefing protection. 

.. note:: Serves to disincentivize griefing attacks against vault, where users create issue requests, temporarily locking a Vault's collateral, but never execute the issue process.

*Substrate*: ``MinimumCollateralUser: Balance;``



IssuePeriod
............

The time difference in number of blocks between a issue request is created and required completion time by a user. The commit period has an upper limit to prevent griefing of vault collateral.

*Substrate* ::

  IssuePeriod: T::BlockNumber;

Maps
----

IssueRequests
.............

Users create issue requests to issue PolkaBTC. This mapping provides access from a unique hash ``IssueId`` to a ``Issue`` struct. ``<IssueId, Issue>``.

*Substrate* ::

  IssueRequests map T::Hash => Issue<T::AccountId, T::BlockNumber, T::Balance>


Structs
-------

Issue
.....

Stores the status and information about a single issue request.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

.. _requestIssue:

requestIssue
-----------

A user opens an issue request by providing a small amount of collateral.

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``requestIssue(requester, amount, vault)``

*Parameters*

* ``requester``: The user's BTC Parachain account.
* ``amount``: The amount of PolkaBTC to be issued.
* ``vault``: The BTC Parachain address of the Vault involved in this issue request.
* ``collateral``: The collateral amount provided by the user.

*Returns*

* ``issueId``: A unique hash identifying the issue request. 

*Events*

* ``RequestIssue(requester, amount, vault, issueId)``

*Errors*

* ``ERR_INSUFFICIENT_COLLATERAL``: The user did not provide enough collateral.
* ``ERR_VAULT_COLLATERAL_RATIO``: The selected vault is below the collateral safety ratio.

*Substrate* ::

  fn requestIssue(origin, amount: U256, vault: AccountId) -> Result {...}


Function Sequence
.................


1. A user prepares the input parameters to the function.
  
    a. ``requester``: The address of the user to receive the PolkaBTC.
    b. ``amount``: The user decides how much PolkaBTC should be issued.
    c. ``vault``: A user picks a vault with enough collateral to open an issue request
    d. ``collateral``: The user transfers collateral against griefing.

2. The user calls the ``requestIssue`` function and provides his own address, the amount, and the vault he wants to use. Further, he provides a small collateral to prevent griefing.

3. Checks if the user provided enough collateral by checking if the collateral is equal or greater than ``MinimumCollateral``. If not, throws ``ERR_INSUFFICIENT_COLLATERAL``.

4. Call the VaultRegistry ``lockVault`` function with the ``amount`` of tokens to be issue, the ``collateral`` that should be reserved for the issue request, and the ``vault`` identified by its address.

5. Generate an ``issueId`` by hashing a random seed, a nonce from the security module, and the address of the user.

6. Store a new ``Issue`` struct in the ``IssueRequests`` mapping. The ``issueId`` refers to the ``Issue``. Fill the ``vault`` with the requested ``vault``, the ``opentime`` with the current block number, the ``collateral`` with the collateral provided by the user, ``amount`` with the ``amount`` provided as input, ``requester`` the requester account, and ``btcAddress`` the Bitcoin address of the Vault.

7. Issue the ``RequestIssue`` event with the ``requester`` account, ``amount``, ``vault``, and ``issueId``.

8. Return the ``issueId``. The user stores this for future reference and the next steps, locally.

.. 
.. *Function Signature*
.. 
.. ``lock(requester, amount, vault, issueId)``
.. 
.. *Parameters*
.. 
.. * ``requester``: The user's BTC Parachain account.
.. * ``amount``: The amount of PolkaBTC to be issued.
.. * ``vault``: The BTC Parachain address of the Vault involved in this issue request.

.. 
.. .. todo:: Do we define the Bitcoin transactions here?
.. 
.. *Bitcoin* ::
.. 
..   OP_RETURN
.. 
.. 
.. Function Sequence
.. .................
.. 
.. 1. The user prepares a Bitcoin transaction with the following details:
.. 
..    a. The input(s) must be spendable from the user.
..    b. The transaction has at least two outputs with the following conditions:
.. 
..         1. One output is spendable by the ``btcAddress`` of the Vault selected in the ``requestIssue`` function. The output includes the ``amount`` requested in the ``requestIssue`` function in the ``value`` field. This means the number of requested PolkaBTC must be the same amount of transferred BTC (expressed as satoshis).
..         2. One output must include a ``OP_RETURN`` with the ``issueId`` received in the ``requestIssue`` function. This output will not be spendable and therefore the ``value`` field should be ``0``.
.. 
.. 2. The user sends the transaction prepared in step 1 to the Bitcoin network and locally stores the ``txId``, i.e. the unique hash of the transaction.


.. _executeIssue:

executeIssue
------------

A user completes the issue request by sending a proof of transferring the defined amount of BTC to the vault's address.

Specification
.............

*Function Signature*

``executeIssue(requester, issueId, txId, txBlockHeight, txIndex, merkleProof, rawTx)``

*Parameters*

* ``requester``: the account of the user.
* ``issueId``: the unique hash created during the ``requestIssue`` function,
* ``txId``: The hash of the Bitcoin transaction.
* ``txBlockHeight``: Bitcoin block height at which the transaction is supposedly included.
* ``txIndex``: Index of transaction in the Bitcoin blockâ€™s transaction Merkle tree.
* ``MerkleProof``: Merkle tree path (concatenated LE SHA256 hashes).
* ``rawTx``: Raw Bitcoin transaction including the transaction inputs and outputs.


*Returns*

* ``True``: if the transaction can be successfully verified and the function has been called within the time limit.
* ``False``: Otherwise.

*Events*

* ``ExecuteIssue(requester, issueId, amount, vault)``:

*Errors*

* ``ERR_ISSUE_ID_NOT_FOUND``: Throws if the ``issueId`` cannot be found.

*Substrate* ::

  fn executeIssue(origin, issueId: T::H256, txId: T::H256, txBlockHeight: U256, txIndex: u64, merkleProof: Bytes, rawTx: Bytes) -> Result {...}


Function Sequence
.................

.. todo:: Insert link to BTC-Relay to get Bitcoin data.

.. todo:: What happens if the Vault goes into buffered collateral/liquidation at this point?


1. The user prepares the inputs and calls the ``executeIssue`` function.
    
    a. ``requester``: The BTC Parachain address of the requester.
    b. ``issueId``: The unique hash received in the ``requestIssue`` function.
    c. ``txId``: the hash of the Bitcoin transaction to the Vault. With the ``txId`` the user can get the remainder of the Bitcoin transaction data including ``txBlockHeight``, ``txIndex``, ``MerkleProof``, and ``rawTx``. See BTC-Relay documentation for details.

2. Checks if the ``issueId`` exists. Throws ``ERR_ISSUE_ID_NOT_FOUND`` if not found. Else, continues.
3. Checks if the current block height minus the ``CommitPeriod`` is smaller than the ``opentime`` specified in the ``Issue`` struct. If this condition is false, throws ``ERR_COMMIT_PERIOD_EXPIRED``. Else, continues.
4. Call *verifyTransactionInclusion* in :ref:`btc-relay`, providing ``txid``, ``txBlockHeight``, ``txIndex``, and ``merkleProof`` as parameters. If this call returns an error, abort and return the received error. 
5. Call *validateTransaction* in :ref:`btc-relay`, providing ``rawTx``, the amount of to-be-issued BTC (``Issue.amount``), the ``vault``'s Bitcoin address (``Issue.btcAddress``), and the ``issueId`` as parameters. If this call returns an error, abort and return the received error. 
6. Check if the function has thrown an error.

    a. If the function has thrown an error, execute ``free`` in the VaultRegistry to release the locked collateral for this issue request for the vault. Return ``False``.
    b. Else, continue.

7. Call the ``mint`` function in the Treasury with the ``amount`` and the user's address as the ``receiver``.
8. Issue an ``Execute   Issue`` event with the user's address, the issueId, the amount, and the Vault's address.
9. Return ``True``.

Error Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~

``ERR_INSUFFICIENT_COLLATERAL``

* **Message**: "Provided collateral below limit."
* **Function**: :ref:`requestIssue`
* **Cause**: User provided collateral below the ``MinimumCollateral``.

``ERR_VAULT_COLLATERAL_RATIO``

* **Message**: "The vault collateral rate is below the safety limit ."

``ERR_ISSUE_ID_NOT_FOUND``

* **Message**: "Requested issue id not found."
* **Function**: :ref:`executeIssue`
* **Cause**: Issue id not found in the ``IssueRequests`` mapping.

``ERR_COMMIT_PERIOD_EXPIRED``

* **Message**: "Time to issue PolkaBTC expired."
* **Function**: :ref:`executeIssue`
* **Cause**: The user did not complete the issue request within the block time limit defined by the ``CommitPeriod``.

``ERR_TIME_NOT_EXPIRED``

* **Message**: "Time to issue PolkaBTC not yet expired."
* **Function**: :ref:`cancelIssue`
